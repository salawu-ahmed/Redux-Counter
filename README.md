# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

This is a project to practice my react-redux, after this project i will practice building a react counter with the useContext API before moving to learn the redux toolkit.
Afterward i will build a website (follow along) on youtube
then i will convert some of my existing projects to a react-redux toolkit project 


I will build the ui while entirely hardcoding it then i wiill make the neccesary adjustments to implement the redux toolkit.

Build 3 UI's 
Build 3 UI's with state management.

From this project i learnt that every changes or state change must be describe in the action object. Particularly the payload.
